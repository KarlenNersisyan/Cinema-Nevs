## The following libraries were used in the project:

* [Prop-Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)

    * Storybook for React

            Storybook for React is a UI development environment for your React components.
            With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.


            Storybook runs outside of your app.
            So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

    * Getting Started

        ```sh
        cd my-react-app
        npx sb init
        ```

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/storybook-addons) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/publish-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.

Here are some featured storybooks that you can reference to see how Storybook works:

- [Demo of React Dates](http://airbnb.io/react-dates/) - [source](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates)
- [Demo of React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/) - [source](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)

    * Create React App

        Support for [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is handled by [`@storybook/preset-create-react-app`](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-create-react-app).

        _This preset enables support for all Create React App features, including Sass/SCSS and TypeScript._

    * Typescript

        @storybook/react` is now exporting its own types to use with Typescript.
        You don't need to have `@types/storybook__react` installed anymore if it was your case.
        But you probably also need to use types from `@types/node @types/react`
